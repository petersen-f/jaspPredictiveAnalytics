The Predictive Analytics module in JASP adds extensive time series prediction methods to JASP. It combines classical time series methods and machine learning models with quality control concepts. Quality control techniques monitor whether a certain process remains within predefined boundaries. That way one can intervene if the boundaries are crossed to ensure that a product or service has the desired quality. Time series forecasting allows us to predict how a process will develop into the future. That way we can predict ahead of time whether a process goes beyond the boundaries. All prediction models are probabilistic, so we can not only predict _when_ and if a process will go out of control in the future but also quantify how _uncertainty_ we are that it will happen.
