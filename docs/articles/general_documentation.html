<p>Options to create automatic time series features that might improve
prediction accuracy of the models. - Nr. of lags: Number of lags that
are used to create lagged time series variables as features. In the
out-of-sample predictions, the previous predictions are used to create
the lagged variables to prevent data leakage. - Automatic time-based
features: Creates multiple features based on the time variable. For
example, it will create a column that indicates the specific month
(1-12), day (1-31), hour (1-24), minute (1-60)etc. of the time stamp.
This is useful for models that don’t model seasonality automatically. -

variance. - Remove variables that are stronger correlated than: Removes
variables that are strongly correlated with each other. The threshold is

<h5 id="evaluation-plan">Evaluation Plan<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#evaluation-plan"></a>
</h5>
<p>This section allows for evaluating which of the selected models
performs best in terms of predictive performance on the available data.
This is helpful in determining which model should be used for future
predictions. As the goal is to evaluate the predictive performance on
unseen future observation, normal cross validation that randomly selects
training and test data is not appropriate. Instead, the data is split in
such a way that the training data is always before the test data. For
example the model is trained on the first 100 observations and then the
predictive performance is evaluated on the next 10 observations.
Afterwards the data is shifted ahead by a certain amount of observations
and the model process is repeated for multiple times. This is called
rolling window cross validation. The predictive performance is evaluated
on both deterministic and probabilistic metrics that are averaged across
all slices. - Training window: Indicates the number of observations that
are used for training the model. - Prediction window: Indicates the
number of observations that are used for to assess the predictive
performance of each model. - Select slices from: Indicates whether the
slices are selected from the start or the end of the data. - Maximum nr.
of slices: Indicates the maximum number of slices that are used for the
evaluation. The actual number of slices might be lower if the data is
not long enough. - Cumulative training: Indicates if the training window
grows cumulative after each slice or not. Increases time needed for
evaluation as models are trained on longer and longer time periods. -
Show evaluation plan: Plots the evaluation plan used for model
evaluation. - Spread points equally: Ignores the timestamp of each data
point and plots them sequentially as if they would have the same
distance to each other. - Max slices shown: Maximum number of slices
that are shown in the plot. Actual number can be higher.</p>

<p>Ensemble Bayesian model averaging (eBMA) performs model averaging
across the out-of-sample predictions of several models. The weights of
each model are estimated based on the predictive performance of each
model and computed for each slice. The goal is to quantify the
uncertainty of the model selection and improve predictive performance.
The weights of the previous slice are used to adjust the predictions for
the current slice - evaluation metrics are calculated for the adjusted
predictions.</p>

<li>Perform BMA: Performs Bayesian model averaging
<ul>
<li>Method: Determines the algorithm used to calculate the weights of
each model.
<ul>
<li>Expectation-Maximisation (EM): Uses the expectation-maximization
algorithm to estimate the weights of each model. The default and faster.
Sets more model weights to zero than Gibbs sampling.</li>
<li>Gibbs: Performs Gibbs sampling to estimate the weights of each
model. Slower but produces full posterior distribution for each model.
Sets fewer model weights to zero than EM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evaluation Method: Determines how the predictive performance of the
eBMA predictions are evaluated
<ul>
<li>Next test slice: Here the model weights are computed on a whole
slice and then used to adjust the predictions for the next slice for
which the predictive performance is evaluated.</li>
<li>Same test slice: Here the model weights are computed on the first
portion of the slice and then used to adjust the predictions for the
second portion of the slice for which the predictive performance is
evaluated.
<ul>
<li>Last xx percent of data: Determines on which percentage of the slice
the performance of the eBMA method is tested on. For example if the
value is 0.3 then the model weights are computed on the first 70% of the

slice.</li>

</h5>
<p>All metrics are averaged across all slices based on the out-of-sample
prediction. The metrics are: - Model: Name of the model. - Continuous
ranked probability score (CRPS): Compares the predicted cumulative
density function (CDF) to the actual CDF. Generalisation of the mean
absolute error (MAE) to a whole predictive density. The lower the CRPS,
the better the model. - Dawid-Sebastiani score (DSS): Compares the
predictive density to the actual CDF only through its mean and its
variance. The lower the DSS, the better the model. - Log score (LS):
Compares the predictive density to the actual CDF by measuring the
logarithmic difference between the two. The lower the LS, the better the
model. - Coverage: Proportion of observations that are within the 95%
prediction interval. The higher the coverage, the better the model. -
Bias: Indicates whether predictions are systematically too high or too
low. If the bias is -1 then all predictions are smaller than the actual
value. If the bias is 1 then all predictions are larger than the actual
value. The closer the bias is to 0, the more unbiased the model. -
Probability Integral Transform (PIT): Evaluates the calibration of the
model by treating the test observation as a random variable coming from
the predictive distribution. If the PIT value is 0.5 then the model is
perfectly calibrated. If the PIT value is 0 then the model is
overconfident and if the PIT value is 1 then the model is
underconfident. The closer the PIT value is to 0.5, the better the
model.</p>

<h5 id="pit-density-density-plot">PIT Density Density Plot<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pit-density-density-plot"></a>
</h5>
<p>Plots the PIT values for each model averaged across all slices. The
x-axis displays the PIT values and the y-axis displays the density. If
the model is perfectly calibrated then the density should be uniform
across the PIT values with a density of 0.1 for each bar.</p>

<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="prediction-plot">Prediction Plot<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#prediction-plot"></a>
</h5>
<p>Displays the actual observations and the predictions of the selected
models. The x-axis displays the time points and the y-axis displays the
values of the time series variable. The different models are displayed
in different colors and the corresponding model names are displayed in
the legend.</p>

<h5 id="bma---model-weights">BMA - Model Weights<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bma---model-weights"></a>
</h5>
<p>Displays the model weights either averaged across all slices or for
each slice seperately. - Model: Name of the model. - Weights:
Corresponding toe the model weight assigned during eBMA. Higher weights
indicates better predictive performance. Formally defined as the
probability that the observations originated from each model.</p>

<h5 id="future-prediction-plot">Future Prediction Plot<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#future-prediction-plot"></a>
</h5>
<p>Plots the predictions for the unobserved future. The black dashed
line indicates the start of the prediction. The blue area indicates the
95% prediction interval. The x-axis displays the time points and the
y-axis displays the values of the time series variable. If a red dashed
line is present it indicates the time point where the control bounds are
exceeded depending on the probability threshold.</p>
